\title[Improving Microarray Layout: Pivot Partitioning] % (optional, use only with long paper titles)
{Improving the Layout of Oligonucleotide Microarrays: Pivot Partitioning}

%% \subtitle
%% {Include Only If Paper Has a Subtitle}

\author[S.~A.~de~Carvalho~Jr. (Universit\"at Bielefeld)] % (optional, use only with lots of authors)
{S\'ergio A. de Carvalho Jr.\inst{1,}\inst{2}\inst{,3} \and Sven Rahmann\inst{1,}\inst{2}}
% - Give the names in the same order as the appear in the paper.
% - Use the \inst{?} command only if the authors have different
%   affiliation.

\institute[Universit\"{a}t Bielefeld] % (optional, but mostly needed)
{
\inst{1}%
Algorithms and Statistics for Systems Biology, Genome Informatics,\\
Technische Fakult\"at, Universit\"at Bielefeld, Germany
\and
\inst{2}%
International NRW Graduate School in Bioinformatics and Genome Research
\and
\inst{3}%
Graduiertenkolleg Bioinformatik
}
% - Use the \inst command only if there are several affiliations.
% - Keep it simple, no one is interested in your street address.

\date[WABI 2006] % (optional, should be abbreviation of conference name)
{6th Workshop on Algorithms in Bioinformatics\\Z\"urich, Sep 2006}
% - Either use conference name or its abbreviation.
% - Not really informative to the audience, more for people (including
%   yourself) who are reading the slides online
